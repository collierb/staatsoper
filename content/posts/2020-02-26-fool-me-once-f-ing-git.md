### Website building in RStudio with Blogdown

I'm a self-confessed luddite. 43 and never learnt to drive. I mostly get around by bicycle. I don't have a telly, microwave, dishwasher, tumble dryer etc. I mow my lawn with this...

This is all borne of a particular, peculiar individuality. Naturally, I'm an environmentalist, but I'm also prone to a state of inertia, stubborn, independent and cynical. How I ended up pursuing a career in tech is beyond me.

But here we are, and here I am on a wintry Sunday morning listening to the radio, with my coffee and a 'to do' list. I've already made my brownies (it's my birthday tomorrow so I have to bring cakes into work - surely that's the wrong way around).

- make brownies
- make website
- keep an eye on the wind

And actually it might not be so bad. I've been reading around the subject and feel relatively clued-up, thanks in the main to the clear and concise [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) documentation. How long, then, can it possibly take?

As ever, what you don't know is as important as what you do. I have only recently installed Git, mostly because I object massively to the name. But having done so, I should really have taken a little time figuring out what it does and how to use it.

I didn't and 6 hours later, through a blur of Google searching and the gentle murmur of the radio (what was the score in the footy again?) I give up. In an extraordinary fit of pique, I delete not only my project folder and concurrent repository but all my other repositories on Github too (not so anarchic - there were only 3).

Frustrated, annoyed at myself but still with a nagging sense of curiosity (other people can understand this - why can't I?). I try one more Google search - this looks promising...

But I also notice that there's an hour of daylight left and the bare branches of the trees have stopped moving for what seems like the first time in months. The wind will be gale force by morning again - this is the very definition of a window of opportunity. Git can wait, the f-ing git...
