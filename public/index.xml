      <description>It is a peculiarity, perhaps, of the English language - certainly in its modern guise - that quite often the native speakers of ‘it’ are actually worse at ‘it’ than their second language counterparts. I can’t recall being taught any grammar in school - much of what I know about the rules of the language come from my father being such a pedant and from my brief time teaching English in Spain.</description>

      <description>This site follows my journey through the murky world of tech.
How did I end up here - a lifelong cyclist, sun-worshiper and surfer I find myself now in my 40&amp;rsquo;s sat at a desk staring at one, two, three screens. Sometimes it makes me curious, but mostly I just feel an over-riding sense of frustration.</description>

      <description>Website building in RStudio with Blogdown I&amp;rsquo;m a self-confessed luddite. 43 and never learnt to drive. I mostly get around by bicycle. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a telly, microwave, dishwasher, tumble dryer etc. I mow my lawn with this&amp;hellip;
This is all borne of a particular, peculiar individuality. Naturally, I&amp;rsquo;m an environmentalist, but I&amp;rsquo;m also prone to a state of inertia, stubborn, independent and cynical. How I ended up pursuing a career in tech is beyond me.</description>
